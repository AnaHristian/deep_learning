    "#### Sequence Length and Batch size  \n",
    "\n",
    "For sequence length, I tried a bigger dimension but didn’t get a better accuracy. The sequence length of size ten and a batch size of 128 improved the model’s training time. It created an array (window) with ten columns by 128 rows on which to train. This allowed the model to train better. A bigger batch size took to long to train and actually it can decrease performance.\n",

    "#### Embedding Dimension, Hidden Dimension, Number of RNN layers\n",
    "\n",
    "A good embedding dimension is between 200 and 300. I tried different sizes and the one which gave a better performance is 300, with a number of hidden units of 512, which is large enough to have capacity to learn the function. Usually larger is better performance wise. Common values are 128, 256, 512. Setting it larger then the number of inputs has been observed to be beneficial in a number of tasks. \n",
    "Number of RNN layers of 2 showed to be beneficial. Increasing it to three gives mixed results, typically between 1-3.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have to mention that I added a dropout layer to my model’s architecture and it actually decreased the performance. I tried a dropout of 0.2 and 0.3 and added it before the fully connected layer. It didn’t make the model learn well enough. I decided to remove the dropout layer and, as a result, I got better performance. "
